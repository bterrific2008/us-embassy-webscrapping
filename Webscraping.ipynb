      "PEPFAR, Nike Foundation and Gates Foundation Partnership Restores Hope for an AIDS-free Future for Girls     Ask an adolescent girl about her dreams for the future and hopefully you will hear bold ambitions: dreams of becoming a doctor, lawyer, scientist or a teacher. You might learn of dreams to travel the world or dreams to one day get married and start a family. You will never hear a girl dream of becoming infected with HIV. But this week alone, more than 7,000 adolescent girls and young women — future doctors, lawyers, teachers, travelers and mothers — will become infected with the virus. HIV/AIDS is the leading cause of death among adolescent girls and young women age 15-24 in sub-Saharan Africa. Young women and girls in the region are twice as likely to be living with HIV as boys and men the same age, and account for one in four new infections in the region. These are tragic and troubling statistics that stand in contrast to the considerable progress the global community has made to control the epidemic. New HIV infections across all populations have dropped by nearly 20 percent since 2010 and more people than ever are receiving life-saving antiretroviral treatment and living healthy and productive lives. Despite success in other areas, like prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission, HIV prevention efforts to date have not successfully addressed the many challenges that make young women and adolescent girls particularly vulnerable to infection. Cultural norms and economic disadvantage prevent many girls from accessing the education and health services they need to thrive. Another key vulnerability is gender-based violence: according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Violence Against Children Surveys, in some countries one in three adolescent girls reports some kind of sexual violence in childhood. Millions of girls around the world also face child marriage, making them vulnerable to violence, and likely impacting their ability to pursue their education. These challenges increase a girl’s risk for HIV, unintended pregnancy, gender-based violence, and exploitation. If young women and adolescent girls are fully empowered and had the means to protect themselves — to live determined, resilient, empowered , AIDS-free, mentored, and safe lives — the HIV/AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa might look very different. We need to deliver on this vision. That is why the United States (U.S.) is proud to launch a new partnership, through theU.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the Nike Foundation, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which will — for the first time — scale-up a core package of evidence-based interventions to address the many interlocking challenges that face adolescent girls and young women in the hardest hit countries in Eastern and Southern Africa. In practice, this will mean offering gender-based violence prevention and care for survivors to restore safety and foster resilience; increasing condom use and availability to empower young women to prevent infection; mapping sexual networks to decrease risk in sexual partners; and providing educational and economic opportunities to girls to help safeguard their future. When implemented individually, these interventions and others have successfully addressed risk behaviors, HIV transmission, and gender-based violence. When implemented together — as part of a package — they have the potential to be even more impactful and help girls stay healthy, safe and resilient. No girl anywhere dreams of living with HIV. It’s time we come together to prevent HIV and accelerate our efforts to achieve an AIDS-free generation — and enable girls everywhere to live their dreams.

      "Victory over TB: Thabo Palesane’s story “I’m  thankful to the South African Health System to be alive because TB can be prevented and cured yet it can be fatal if left unattended” –  these are the words of a TB survivor and ambassador, Thabo Pelesane. Pelesane, who was born in the township of Jouberton in Klerksdrop, North West, suffered with TB for 22 long years. He remembers having to adhere to a series of 40 day injection treatment and regular visits to the clinic. His own father succumbed to the same illness in 2005, while his mother managed to win the battle over the disease, and survived. This father of two was first diagnosed in 1989 at the age of 13, but was determined to stay positive in his mind-set. His first visit to the hospital was soon after he started experiencing symptoms such as violent coughing and night sweats; tests that were conducted on Pelesane confirmed he had TB. Pelesane remembers the turning point that came when he was walking home from work and could taste blood in his mouth, he was rushed to the nearby clinic – Wilmedpark in Klerksdorp, where they admitted him for several days. The next day he went through tests that revealed he had developed cavities within his lungs as a result of his condition, this had resulted in scarring, which meant that he had to begin treatment again. He stayed on treatment until the day he was due for an operation – a day Pelesane will forever cherish. After so many years of struggling with the disease, doctors took him through a series of tests and revealed that he was finally free from TB, and the scheduled operation was cancelled. Pelesane ‘s story  is one of hope, today he has a testimony to make. In fact, he has since made it his responsibility to spread the word on how people should deal with TB from diagnosis till it gets treated.  For the past two years, he has been making public appearances in a bid to encourage people to live healthy lifestyles and routinely visit health professionals to determine if their health is sound. He is also an ambassador for the We Beat TB campaign, which is being implemented by the University Research Council and funded by the United States International Agency for Development. “I’m often invited by the Motlosana Municipality’s health desk to create awareness among residents during public gatherings. The message that I always spread is that don’t give up, TB can be cured. I lived with it for about two decades” He is grateful to his mother, friends and colleagues who supported him throughout his dark days. He encourages people to take care of their own health by constantly using the public facilities to check on their status of health. ” I take my two daughters for tests  and would encourage other parents do take responsibility of their own health and that of their children.” Although Pelesane was often sick he continued serving the community of Motlasana library, working as a librarian alongside friends and colleagues who supported him during his ordeal with TB. And today( as a tribute to the child he was when we first had TB), is part of a national campaign to end TB in children, which is often undiagnosed and under reported.

      "The Power of Partnership: Extraordinary Progress, Lessons Learned and Great Hope for the Future in South Africa South Africa, with support from the United States through the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), provides more than 2.4 million of its people with antiretroviral treatment (ART) – saving countless lives, keeping families together, and increasing South Africa’s overall economic productivity. Since 2004, PEPFAR has invested more than $4.2 billion in South Africa’s HIV and TB response, helping to support an unprecedented expansion of prevention, treatment, and care services. Initially, to help stem the rising tides of these dual epidemics, PEPFAR directly supported a substantial share of clinical care and treatment services in South Africa. In recent years, as the South African economy has grown and through committed political leadership, the South Africa government (SAG) has assumed greater managerial and financial responsibility for these functions — investing nearly $1.5 billion annually of its own resources for HIV/AIDS efforts. As the SAG continues to expand access to ART, PEPFAR has increasingly focused its support on strengthening the capacity of the South African public health system and the health workforce to deliver quality HIV- and TB-related health services. This has entailed PEPFAR gradually moving its assistance toward support for health systems strengthening; training and mentoring of clinicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers; HIV prevention; health services innovation and integration; and strengthening systems for orphans and vulnerable children. Together, PEPFAR’s technical assistance and the SAG’s increasing investments in direct HIV service provision are bringing ART and other essential health services closer to where patients reside, and creating a more accessible and sustainable health system. Since 2010, South Africa has expanded the number of clinics providing ART in the country from 490 to 3,540 — a truly remarkable achievement — and rolled out a national policy of decentralized HIV services. This approach has also involved shifting toward a nurse-initiated service delivery model at primary health centers and away from services delivered mainly by doctors at hospitals. Greatly increased accessibility of ART at public sites has allowed for PEPFAR and the SAG to partner in transitioning some patients to these public sites from PEPFAR-supported non-public sites. At present, 35,000 individuals, or less than 2 percent of the 2.4 million people receiving ART in South Africa, are receiving treatment in non-public sites supported by PEPFAR; the vast majority of patients are now accessing ART through public sites or other private facilities. In large part due to increased access to treatment, South Africa has experienced a significant increase in life expectancy in just six years, from 54 years in 2005 to 60 in 2011. South Africa’s rate of infections in infants born to HIV-positive mothers has also declined from 8.0 percent in 2009 to 2.2 percent in 2013 — a significant accomplishment in just four years. Our health partnership with South Africa is becoming a model for other PEPFAR-supported countries. Like any new concept, there are challenges along the way and important lessons to be learned. Throughout the partnership’s evolution, we have never lost sight of our primary shared goals: to enable more people in need of HIV/AIDS services to receive them, and those who already receive these services to continue doing so. Strong partnerships with many diverse stakeholders are vital to achieving these goals. That is why PEPFAR continues to work with national, provincial, and local governments; academic institutions; non-government organizations; civil society; and the private sector in South Africa and other countries to drive innovation toward a more effective, efficient, and durable HIV and TB response. Where we face challenges, we work jointly to address them. For example, as some patients move from one facility to another, they can get lost in the system. Preventing this “loss to follow-up” is a challenge in any health system, including in the United States. PEPFAR continues to work closely with the SAG to support the rollout of monitoring systems to ensure patients are properly tracked over time and retained in care. While there are difficulties in preventing patient loss to follow-up, to date, these tracking systems have produced encouraging results. Program data from multiple PEPFAR-supported programs show that of the more than 12,000 patients who transitioned from PEPFAR-supported non-public sites to public clinics during 2012, 91-96 percent successfully continued care – an impressive rate of retention by any measure. Moreover, this figure likely overestimates the number lost to follow-up, as failure to find a patient does not necessarily mean that the individual is no longer receiving care, but may have moved to another area. Whenever health services are decentralized and patients shift from one health facility to another, there are always unforeseen obstacles that must be overcome. As PEPFAR’s partnerships with South Africa and other host governments continually evolve toward greater country ownership, we are committed to act quickly and responsibly to mitigate problems that may arise. The benefits to individuals and societies are enormous when HIV and other primary health services are more accessible closer to home and delivered through a stronger health system. Through this innovative health partnership model, which entails a new level of collaboration, coordination, and co-investment, we are already seeing improved results. This not only supports the patients of today, but also it lays the foundation for a better, healthier, and more sustainable future for all South Africans.

      "PEPFAR Stories of Survival in Rural Mpumalanga Province A person needs to spend only a moment speaking with a staff member at the Amsterdam Community Health Centre (CHC) or one of the 1,430 patients currently receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) at the facility to understand the benefits of Nurse Initiated and Managed Antiretroviral Treatment (NIMART). Caring nurses like BroadReach’s Nurse Mentor Elza Marx tops the chart. Thanks to assistance from PEFPAR, the ability for nurses to initiate HIV-positive patients onto ART and mentor other cadres of healthcare professionals has irrevocably changed not only HIV and AIDS services offered in facilities like Amsterdam throughout South Africa, but also the hearts and minds of countless patients receiving this vital care. Situated in rural South Africa, less than 20 kilometres from the Swaziland border in eastern Mpumalanga, Amsterdam CHC serves a population of approximately 24,000 people; with 3,000 to 4,000 patients visiting the facility each month. A longstanding USAID partner, BroadReach Healthcare, has received PEPFAR funding in recent years. The organization supports Amsterdam CHC to scale up comprehensive care, treatment and management of HIV (CCMT); as well as HIV and AIDS, Sexually Transmitted Infections and Tuberculosis (HAST) services by providing technical assistance, training, data management, mentorship and management support since 2008. Part of BroadReach’s assistance to the CHC included temporary bridge funding for key staff in positions to support the Department of Health’s human resource needs. These positions have now been absorbed on a permanent basis by South Africa’s Department of Health. BroadReach Healthcare’s temporary support; Nurse Marx was able to attend one of the first NIMART courses at Stellenbosch University. Upon completion of training and in an effort to leverage her expertise and skill set, she transitioned into a mentorship role to support other nurses in their treatment efforts. To date and across 2 sub-districts, Nurse Marx has mentored 66 professional nurses who have gone on to initiate 2,467 patients. In addition to nurse mentors, she has mentored 26 lay counselors, 11 enrolled nurses, and 10 administration/data clerks. Truly her mentorship efforts are lending to improved patient care and efficiently run facilities. USAID and BroadReach together are building the capacity of the Department of Health and enabling the effective initiation of thousands of patients in Gert Sibande District. As Amsterdam is located nearly 50 kilometres from the nearest hospital, Nurse Marx’s NIMART training and mentorship work has allowed many at the CHC to access treatment who had previously been unable, due to monetary, time or transport constraints. In large part due to PEPFAR assistance via USAID’s partnership with BroadReach Healthcare, two such patients who have enjoyed life changing medical attention are Mr. Mduduzi Yende and *Mrs Khumalo. Mduduzi Yende has firsthand knowledge of Nurse Marx’s impact in Amsterdam. Mduduzi was diagnosed with HIV when he first met Nurse Marx. He arrived at the CHC with night sweats, pain and vomiting. Mduduzi was afraid to test for HIV. Nurse Marx encouraged him to learn his status and even visited him at home, providing comfort and support, whilst informing him that the diagnosis was “not the end of the road”. At the time of initiation in March 2010, Mr. Yende was co-infected with extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and reported a CD4 count of 349. Today, Mr. Yende is healthy and doing well on ART with an undetectable viral load and CD4 count of 350. Influenced by his experiences with Nurse Marx and other mentees of Nurse Marx, Mr. Yende now works with a leading NGO, Treatment Action Campaign, advocating for the rights of those impacted by HIV/AIDS. He promotes male medical circumcision (MMC) and HIV Counseling and Testing (HCT) among men in his town. He desires to reach his entire community with relevant HIV information, because, as he says “if you are not infected, you are affected.” Nearly at death’s door, Mr. Yende is now a vibrant, vocal community activist for prevention and treatment, and a shining example of survival and triumph over a very grim diagnosis! Mrs. Khumalo’s* story is one of hope amid heartbreak and the importance of caring, intervening medical professionals. In 2008, Mrs. Khumalo brought her 15 year old son to Nurse Marx to find out why he was inexplicably sick and losing weight. Nurse Marx examined the young boy and, given his symptoms, recommended he be given an HIV test. Unfortunately, he tested positive and not long after, died of complications from taking both traditional medicines and ARVs. As if the misfortune of losing her only son was not enough, Mrs. Khumalo returned to the CHC a few years later; she was also feeling ill with worrying symptoms. She was immediately diagnosed as HIV-positive in January 2010. Although eligible for ART, her husband, Mr. Khumalo*, demanded she be treated by a traditional healer and initially refused to allow her to take ARVs. Through much persuasion, Nurse Marx was able to convince Mr. Khumalo to agree to let his wife take ARVs, and also convinced him to take an HIV test. Despite testing positive with a very low CD4 of 56, Mr. Khumalo refused ART. He preferred to take traditional medicine, in spite of being seriously ill. When Mr. Khumalo’s CD4 dropped further, Nurse Marx intervened with the help of a fellow clinician, and the two helped Mr. Khumalo to see the benefits of treatment and understand that he would die without ART. Today, both Mr. and Mrs. Khumalo are on ART and are living healthier lives. Mrs. Khumalo greatly admires Nurse Marx, grateful that her diligent dedication has saved both her and her husband. “She [Nurse Marx] has helped a lot of patients here. She gives her time to the patients. She loves the patients.” Recognizing the important roles that prevention, treatment and adherence efforts have in the wellbeing of her community; Nurse Marx currently mentors numerous other healthcare professionals. She hopes that all clinics in the province will soon be able to offer NIMART and have BroadReach Healthcare mentors in their facilities to further support the thousands requiring life saving treatment. *Name has been changed.

      "Siyayinqoba: Beat It! Conquers Fear of HIV Testing Siyayinqoba Beat It!, a South African magazine show produced by the Community Health Media Trust (CMT) discusses hard-hitting topics about people living with HIV. Not content with using a mass media to reach out on a national level, CMT goes one step further: with funding from PEPFAR through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the team has rolled out a comprehensive social mobilization campaign using the catchy Siyayinqoba brand at all levels of media, starting at national and reaching out to local communities through thought-provoking radio talk shows, news articles and even taxis branded with HIV prevention messaging. CMT’s new project team, based in rural Mthatha in the Eastern Cape, works with local NGOs and community platforms to create a communication cascade that ensures the flow of HIV prevention and health information to all corners of the communities in the predominantly isiXhosa province. CMT works closely with TB/HIV Care Association, also PEPFAR funded, that provides staffing for local clinics and mobile units to take HIV testing, screening for TB and sexually transmitted infections to the people. On the ground, CMT holds regular door-to-door campaigns followed by “open days” especially in the two districts with high HIV prevalence — the OR Tambo and Alfred Nzo health districts. Traditional chiefs and healers, and ward councilors lead discussions about HIV and health issues that are central to the lives of these communities, while guest speakers provide expert knowledge on treatment and prevention. TB/HIV Care Association attend each and every open day, providing immediate HIV counseling and testing and TB screening. Apart from the stigma and ignorance that surrounds the HI virus, people are surprisingly still very scared to test for HIV.   They are afraid of the test results. They are afraid of what their families and loved ones will say. These open day and door-to-door drives aim to dispel this fear. Nothobile Pasekile Mbele is a 49-year-old woman who took the step.  When CMT and TB/HIV Care Association arrived in her home town of Maluti, she plucked up all her courage to be tested. “I am not afraid of the results as I’d rather know in time so that I can get the necessary treatment should the need arise,” she said before testing. People like Nothobile are the champions who drive the success of these campaigns. Since the start of this project in March 2012, CMT has participated in a record 12 open days, reaching nearly 7,000 people. More than 620 people have bravely stepped forward to undergo HIV counseling and testing, and more than 200 have been screened for TB. The eight door-to-door campaigners have managed to visit more than 1,000 households in these hard-to-reach rural villages, and in total 5,435 people have been visited. Of those, a fifth were referred to local clinics for a range of preventative health services. Mass media communication does reach people, and cascading HIV and TB messages through various levels from national to the face-to-face and on-the-ground awareness and education. With this waterfall of messaging and services, CMT will empower communities and conquer the fear of HIV counseling and testing reaching out to all levels of society. As one Mthatha resident when visited by a door-to-door educator declared: “I’ve seen Siyayinqoba on the TV, I heard Siyayinqobaon the radio talking about HIV and now you’re here at my house!” By U.S. Mission South Africa | 14 August, 2012 | Categories: PEPFAR \n",
